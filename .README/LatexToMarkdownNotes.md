# General Notes on how to modify, and compile this

1. Install Pandoc on your system (should be largely multi-platform).
2. Have a means to execute bash scripts (WSL, Linux, Windows bash, etc.).
3. Run the buildREADMERelease.sh **AFTER** having previewed it and corrected any issues within.
4. Review the generated README for errors, issues in cross compiling etc.
5. Commit new README as the final commit in your branch, trunk, fork's pull request. **OR** as a single commit within a new "name_README_purpose" (ex Sasso_README_SpellingAndFormatting) branch to allow code review before approving changes.
